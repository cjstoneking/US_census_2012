# US_census_2012

In this project, I take a large dataset from the 2012 US Census and preprocess it so it can be visualized in Tableau.  
The dataset consists of numbers of businesses (called "Establishments" in census terminology), which are broken down by:
a) the US state they are in
b) the sector they are in
c) the approximate number of employees
