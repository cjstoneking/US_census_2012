# US_census_2012

In this project, I take a large dataset from the 2012 US Census and preprocess it so it can be visualized in Tableau.  
The dataset consists of numbers of manufacturing businesses (called "Establishments" in census terminology), which are broken down by:\
a) the US state they are in\
b) the sector they are in\
c) the approximate number of employees\

The original datafile is available from https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2012/econ/census/2012-manufacturing.html, link under "State". The download has multiple files, the main datafile is ECN_2012_US_31SA1_with_ann.csv

I also use the 2012 census estimates of the state populations, which can be found under https://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-census-population-migration-births-deaths-estimates.html, or in the .csv which I added to this project.
